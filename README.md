<p>Today I learned in this lesson how to create a function
 and how to call that function in the program
</p>
▪️The codeblock for creating functions in Python

```markdown
```python

def function_name(parameters):
 code_here
```
If we write a function in Python, we need to start the code with `def`, then write `function name`, and finally, write parameters inside the `()`. 
Then you can see an example for this in the <a href ="DAY8/lesson1.py">lesson1.py</a> 

▪️The code for how to call a created function in Python

```markdown
function_name(parameters)
```
